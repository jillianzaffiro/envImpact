Text for description:

This project adds a bridge from north Covington to south Cincinnati over the Ohio River.
It will be 3 lanes, 2 dedicated lanes and a reversible center lane, with a span of 750 feet.

Welcome to the Environmental Impact Estimator
A project owner can use the estimator tool to get an early idea of the impact of various construction projects.
The owner can simply enter the name and description of the project and optionally,
they can provide some additional information such as the sector.

The tool uses NLP techniques to process the inputs and extract information such as the project type and various parameters.

As you can see here, the tool successfully discovered the type of project, the length and number of lanes.
When the parameters can't be extracted from the description, the tool uses AI techniques to match the project to known projects
and then uses those parameters.

The final step uses these parameters as inputs to LCA tools as well as a rule-based system that uses
calculations based on recommendations from the EPA, the Green Project initiative, as well as others.
The results are aggregated before being shown to the user.

Currently, only CO2 is calculated, but other factors can be included as the tool evolves and improves.

Project owners now have a tool that allows them to gain additional insight into the environmental effects of different projects.
